    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 23, 2026</p>

    <p>Dukaan Voice ("we", "our", or "the App") is a voice-first collaborative inventory management application designed for Indian retail businesses. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and your rights regarding your data.</p>

    <p>By using Dukaan Voice, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Full name</strong> — provided during sign-up</li>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for authentication and account recovery</li>
      <li><strong>Password</strong> — encrypted and managed by our authentication provider (Clerk)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive your name and email from the OAuth provider. We do not access your Google or Apple account password.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Voice Recordings</h3>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Voice recordings are processed in real-time and are <strong>not stored permanently</strong>. Audio is transmitted to our server, processed by Sarvam AI for speech recognition and natural language understanding, and immediately discarded after processing. Only the resulting text transcript is stored in your audit log for your reference.</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio is recorded on your device (WAV format on iOS, M4A on Android)</li>
      <li>Recordings are limited to a maximum of 30 seconds</li>
      <li>Audio is sent to our server as encoded data via a secure connection</li>
      <li>After processing, the audio data is discarded from server memory</li>
      <li>Text transcripts are stored in your shop's audit log so you can review past actions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Inventory & Business Data</h3>
    <p>When you use the App, we store the business data you create:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shop information (name, category, preferred language)</li>
      <li>Product catalog (names, barcodes, categories, units, prices)</li>
      <li>Stock quantities, batch numbers, purchase dates, expiry dates, supplier names</li>
      <li>Buy list items and notes</li>
      <li>Audit logs recording inventory changes (action type, user, timestamp, transcript, confidence score)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 User Preferences</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>App language and voice language selection</li>
      <li>Voice feedback preference (on/off)</li>
      <li>Display settings (high contrast mode, text size)</li>

      <li>Invite codes generated for team collaboration</li>
      <li>Last active timestamps within shops</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.6 Device & Diagnostic Data</h3>
    <p>In production builds, we use Sentry for crash reporting. This collects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type, operating system, and app version</li>
      <li>Crash reports and error stack traces</li>
      <li>Performance data (sampled at 20% of sessions)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Crash reporting is disabled in development builds and can be minimized by the sampling rate we apply.</p>
