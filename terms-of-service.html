    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 23, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to Dukaan Voice. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Dukaan Voice mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Dukaan Voice is a voice-first collaborative inventory management application designed for Indian retail businesses. The Service allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manage product inventory using voice commands in multiple Indian languages</li>
      <li>Track stock levels, batches, expiry dates, and purchase information</li>
      <li>Collaborate with team members through role-based access (Owner, Manager, Helper)</li>
      <li>View audit trails of all inventory changes</li>
      <li>Manage buy lists and receive stock-level alerts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To use the Service, you must create an account by providing accurate and complete information. You are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials</li>
      <li>All activity that occurs under your account</li>
      <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to create an account and use the Service.</p>

    <h2>3. User Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Dukaan Voice uses a role-based access control system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Creates and manages shops, invites team members, has full access to all shop data and settings, and can delete the shop</li>
      <li><strong>Manager:</strong> Can manage inventory, view reports, and perform most operations within the shop</li>
      <li><strong>Helper:</strong> Can add and remove stock items as directed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As an Owner, you are responsible for managing access to your shop and the data within it. When you invite members, they gain access to your shop's inventory data.</p>

    <h2>4. Voice Input</h2>
    <p>The Service processes voice commands using third-party AI services. Please be aware that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Voice recordings are limited to a maximum of 30 seconds per command</li>
      <li>The Service supports multiple languages including English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Hinglish</li>
      <li>Voice recognition accuracy depends on audio quality, background noise, accent, and language clarity</li>
      <li>You should review voice-processed inventory changes to confirm accuracy</li>
      <li>Voice audio is processed in real-time and is not permanently stored (see our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts or shops</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure</li>
      <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the application</li>
      <li>Use automated tools to access the Service beyond normal usage patterns</li>
      <li>Share invite codes publicly or with individuals not intended to join your shop</li>
      <li>Misrepresent your identity or role within a shop</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Data</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of the business data you enter into the Service (product information, inventory records, etc.). We do not claim ownership of your content.</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you grant us a limited license to store, process, and transmit your data solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service.</p>
    <p>For details on how we collect, use, and protect your data, please review our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
    <p>We strive to keep the Service available at all times, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Planned maintenance or updates</li>
      <li>Technical issues beyond our control</li>
      <li>Third-party service outages (authentication, voice processing, database hosting)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are not liable for any losses resulting from Service downtime.</p>

    <h2>8. Rate Limits</h2>
    <p>To ensure fair usage and service stability, the Service enforces rate limits on API requests. Exceeding these limits may result in temporary throttling of your requests.</p>

    <h2>9. Account Termination</h2>
    <p>You may delete your account at any time through <strong>Settings &gt; Delete Account</strong> in the App. Account deletion is permanent and irreversible — all your shops, inventory data, audit logs, and preferences will be permanently removed.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or engage in abusive behavior.</p>

    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Dukaan Voice application, including its design, code, branding, and documentation, is our intellectual property. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the application without our written permission.</p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We specifically disclaim warranties of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose</li>
      <li>Accuracy of voice recognition or AI-generated suggestions</li>
      <li>Uninterrupted or error-free operation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Voice-based inventory actions are aids — you should verify critical stock decisions independently.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inventory discrepancies resulting from voice recognition errors</li>
      <li>Business losses due to Service downtime</li>
      <li>Data loss beyond what is covered by our standard backup procedures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in India.</p>
